# Weather Widget ... ReScripted!

This is an attempt to recreate my simple
[weather widget](https://github.com/chriswilty/weather-widget)
using
[ReScript's React bindings](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction).

## ReScript, hmm ....

!["Red Dwarf Cat: So what is it?"](src/assets/images/so-what-is-it.jpg)

[ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org)
is a strongly-typed functional programming language based on
[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/what-and-why),
which in turn is based on the type system of
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/manual/coreexamples.html).

> "So what is it?"

Rescript is a language targeted at front-end JavaScript developers: it not only
offers a syntax familiar to JavaScript developers (including JSX), it actually
outputs _optimized_ JavaScript.

> "So what is it?"

Look, just read the
[ReScript blog](https://rescript-lang.org/blog/bucklescript-is-rebranding)
for a full explanation.

## Installation

Yarn 2 PnP (a.k.a. zero-installs) is not supported by ReScript yet, so you'll need to install in the usual way:

- `yarn`

## Build

- `yarn start` - run in dev mode
- `yarn build` - build it
- `yarn clean` - clean it
